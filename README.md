This is a program that is based on genuine data and members. To begin the program, become an admin member and create a channel. Once this is done, you can now add your users to that channel!
Note: This will add an admin member to the server, if you do not want to create multiple, type the EXACT username you used to log in. This applies for users as well.

The most optimal way to do this all would be to hold all data in a database, but since this isn't an option, the data will be held in a multiple text files, which will be read and updated during the program!

You can either generate a user as an admin to fill up the channel/server, or you can end the program and create a user, then join the desired channel. 

Now you can interact with users on the server! I have included the text files in the submission, but if you'd like to test, remove the files and generate new ones using the program!
